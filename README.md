# Sales-Dashboard-using-Power-BI: Vehicle Sales Analysis

This project presents an interactive Power BI dashboard designed to analyze and visualize sales data for a vehicle manufacturing company. The data includes order details, customer information, product categories, revenue, deal size, and geographic distribution — providing a comprehensive view of overall sales performance without inventory-level data.
